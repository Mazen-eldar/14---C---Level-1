What is .NET?
 Platform = Programming Language + Libraries
 .Net is a Platform 
 Languages in .Net Platform are:
 • C#, Visual Basic, and F#...etc.
 Platforms: 
• .Net Core: (runs anywhere) Windows, Linux, and macOS
 • .Net Framework: Websites, services, and desktop apps ..etc on windows
 • Xamarin /Mono : a .NET for Mobile (Cross Platform runs on android or ios)
 All use a standard set of libraries

Who Built .NET?
 Microsoft + several thousands of companies 
 Over 100,000 developers and 3700 Companies 
Contribute to the .NET Platform 
===========================================================================================
.NET Platform
 • .NET is a platform, created by Microsoft, for building and running many 
different types of applications including web, desktop, mobile, gaming, 
IoT, AI, and cloud. 
• It is a comprehensive development platform that provides tools and 
technologies for building all types of applications, including web, 
desktop, mobile, gaming, IoT, AI, and cloud. 
• The .NET platform includes multiple components such as the .NET runtime, 
the Base Class Library (BCL), and the .NET Standard Library.
===========================================================================================
.NET Standard
 • .NET Standard is a formal specification of the APIs that are common across 
.NET implementations. This allows the same code and libraries to run on 
different implementations.
===========================================================================================
.NET Framework
 • ".NET Framework" is one of the components of the .NET platform.
 • It is a specific implementation of the .NET platform that provides a 
runtime environment for executing .NET applications and provides a set of 
libraries for developing and running applications on Windows.
 • The .NET Framework was first released in 2002 and has since been updated 
multiple times to include new features and improvements.
 In short, .NET is a platform, while .NET Framework is one of its 
implementations.
===========================================================================================
.Net vs .Net Core
 • ".NET" and ".NET Core" are both components of the .NET platform, but they 
differ in their design goals and use cases.
 • ".NET Core" is a cross-platform, open-source, and modular implementation of 
the .NET platform. It was created to provide a high-performance, scalable, 
and flexible runtime environment for building modern, cloud-based 
applications that can run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, 
macOS, and Linux. 
• .NET Core provides a subset of the features and libraries available in the 
full .NET platform, but it is designed to be faster, lighter-weight, and 
more efficient.
 • In short, .NET is a comprehensive platform for building all types of 
applications, while .NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source, and modular 
implementation of the .NET platform focused on modern, cloud-based 
applications.

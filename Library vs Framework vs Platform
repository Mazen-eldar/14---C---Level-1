What is Library?
 A library is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use to add 
 functionality to their applications.

A library typically provides a set of functions or classes that a developer 
can call from their code to perform specific tasks, without having to write 
 all the code from scratch.

 Example: Math Library.

What is Framework?
 A framework is a set of libraries and tools that 
provide structure and support for building and 
running applications.


A framework defines a set of rules, protocols, and 
conventions that developers must follow when writing 
their code. This helps ensure that all parts of an 
application work well together and follow a 
consistent design pattern.

What is Platform?
 A platform refers to the hardware or software environment 
 in which a piece of software runs.

 For example, a computer running the Windows operating 
 system could be considered a platform for running 
 software written for Windows

 Platform = Programming Language + Libraries
